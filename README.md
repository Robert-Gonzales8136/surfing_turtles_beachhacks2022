Surfing Turtles: My submission for BeachHacks 2022.
I made this program with kaleblee146. We learned the turtle library and made this project in 24 hours.
I will update this program in my free time. I have many more features in mind for this game. This version is limited and messy because it was part of a challenge.

How it works:
Use the arrow keys to steer the turtle. Avoid the sharks. The sharks get faster each time they cross the screen. The 'head' of the shark will trigger game over.
The tail end of the sharks are safe to travel. A game over stops the sharks and makes the surfing turtle invisible.
If you move the invisible turtle away from away from the shark, the game over will end. We didn't learn about this until after we submitted it.
Some of the code is a failed attempt at restarting the game with an 'enter' button press.
I can now replace this with a function that moves the turtle off screen when 'enter' is pressed.

Enjoy and feel free to leave your thoughts!
